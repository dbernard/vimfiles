2013-11-09
==========

- Update Python syntax highlighting support to version 3.3.5.

- Update ColorSamplerPack to version 2012-10-28.

- Unlink the syntax group pythonDot from Normal; this keeps :hardcopy output
  from having a dark background for dot characters in Python.

- Blacklist Consolas from using g:Powerline_symbols == "unicode", as that font
  doesn't properly support the needed Unicode symbols.

- Enable fontdetect and colorsamplerpack bundles early for use in "-before.vim"
  scripts.

- Allow g:DefaultFontFamilies to be set from "-before.vim" scripts.

- Update swapit plugin to version 0.3.2.

2013-11-05
==========

- Installed Dr. Chip's HiLinkTrace plugin to display the syntax highlighting
  stack.  Use HLT! to toggle display of the syntax stack.  See :help
  notes_hilinktrace for details.

2013-11-03
==========

- Restored :Highlight functionality.  Highlight groups that are cleared via
  ``:highlight clear`` are not removed, but are changed to have the inactive
  value ``xxx cleared``, causing hlexists() to unhelpfully return true.
  Now a new function, HighlightGroupExists(), works around this behavior.

  See :help notes for details on disabling the :Highlight feature.

2013-10-30
==========

- Added the vim-session and vim-misc plugins.  The vim-session plugin provides
  some nice session management features.  Use ``:SaveSession`` to save a
  session, ``:OpenSession`` to load a saved session, and ``:CloseSession`` to
  close the current session.  See ``:help notes_session`` for more information
  about how vim-session is configured, or ``:help session.txt`` to see
  vim-session's documentation

2013-10-29
==========

- Restore customized settings for the fswitch plugin which were accidentally
  lost when adding the ability to override them with .lvimrc files.
  The fswitch plugin provides the \of ("Other File") functionality (see :help
  notes for details).

2013-10-27
==========

- Perform ``:diffupdate`` on <C-L> as part of screen refreshing.

2013-10-03
==========

  Version 0.2.0 provide buffer-local override capabilities for inserting
  header guards.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Upgrade to fontsize 0.3.0, migrating to bundle-based
  installation.  The default keystrokes have changed to <Leader><Leader>x
  instead of <Leader>xx.  See :help fontsize-customization for configuring
  non-default mappings.
